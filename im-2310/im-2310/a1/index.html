				<h3><a href="https://fractalfantasy.net/#liquidentropy">Liquid Entropy by Mika Chernov & Sinjin Hawke</a> </h3>
				<p>is a visual synthesizer project by Fractal Fantasy that is described as an ‘exploration of hydrodynamics, fluid simulation, and psychedelic abstraction’. It features liquid-like shapes and colours that move and interact with each other.</p>

				<h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?                </h3>
				<p>I was drawn to the dynamic and fluid nature of the motion coming from the movement of my control. I enjoyed seeing the simulation of the malleable and constantly changing form of the metallic liquid. As well as the syncing with the audio effects. </p>

				<h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.                </h3>
				<p>Liquid entropy has applications in a variety of fields, including chemistry, physics, and materials science. Some examples include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Exploring the interface and familiarising with the various controls and options available. Note the different parameters that can be adjusted, such as the oscillators, filters, envelopes, and effects.</li>
					<li>Experimenting with different settings and options to create unique sounds and visual effects.</li>
					<li>Figuring out what different effects do and regongise the variety of sounds and textures.              </li>
                    <li>Keep on experimenting until a desired effect has been found.                    </li>

				<h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?                </h3>
				<p>I enjoyed playing with the bars, the controls enable me to incorporate reverberation, vibrato, delay, and adjust other parameters to my liking, resulting in the experience more immersive and engaging.                </p>

            <div class="question">
				<h3>What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?                </h3>
				<p> Moving my mouse and seeing the ripples propagate, and how they generate metallic tones that gradually ascend as if extending infinitely. As well as the curves and bends that mimic the natural flow of liquid, and how the visual incorporates materials that are reflective, further enhances the impression of fluidity and movement.</p>

				<h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?                </h3>
				<p> My impression of the primary goal of 'Liquid Entropy' is to provide a platform for users to explore and experiment with sound in a creative and intuitive way. By using a visual interface inspired by fluid dynamics, the creators of 'Liquid Entropy' aimed to make sound design and manipulation more accessible to a wider audience.</p>

            <div class="question">
				<h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?                </h3>
				<p>The interactive experience effectively communicates its primary goal through its visual interface, user control, physical modeling synthesis, and generative soundscapes. The colorful and fluid-like graphics and interactive elements invite users to experiment with sound-generating components, while the ability to see and hear the results of their changes in real-time encourages further experimentation. The use of physical modeling synthesis and generative soundscapes adds to the project's potential for creative experimentation.  </p>

            <div class="question">
				<h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?                </h3>
				<p> The interaction length should be guided by the level of user engagement. If the user is highly engaged and interested, a longer interaction may be appropriate to sustain their interest and encourage further exploration, and vice versa. However, i do think that the experience should be interacted with limited times as the feature is very unitary.                 </p>

            <div class="question">
				<h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?                </h3>
				<p> The interface allows users to have intuitive and responsive interactions with the web, and where the visual created by the users mimics liquid entropic qualities, as well as being able to adapt and change to the user's needs and preferences.</p>

            <div class="question">
				<h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?                </h3>
				<p>Liquid Entropy itself is a browser-based synthesiser that can be manipulated in real-time, with an emphasis on creating an immersive and interactive experience. However, the project also draws inspiration from a range of digital and multimedia sources, including music production software, digital art tools, and interactive media.</p>

            <div class="question">
				<h3>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?                </h3>
				<p>Liquid Entropy can be explored in unconventional ways. The website can be interacted with playfulness and experimentation, so there is many different creative possibilities that can be uncovered. Once a sound or visual effect has been explored, it could always be incorporated or influenced into other music production or digital art project.  </p>

            <div class="question">
				<h3>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?                </h3>
				<p>Users should feel adventurous when interacting with 'Liquid Entropy'. The interface is intuitive and visually appealing, thus encourage users to experiment with the different settings to create unique sounds and visual effects. Additionally, users should feel a sense of control over the music-making process, with the ability to easily manipulate the various controls and parameters. This can lead to a feeling of empowerment and satisfaction as users create their own unique sounds and compositions. Ultimately, 'Liquid Entropy' provides a fun and engaging experience for users, allowing them to explore their creativity and express themselves through music in a unique and interactive way.</p>
